## W0717 (too-many-try-statements)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
try:
    option a    # if option a fails, it should be ignored, and go to option b
    option b    # if option b fails, it should be ignored, and go to option c
    option c    # if option c fails, it should be ignored, and go to option d
    option d
except:
    pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
try:
    option a
except ExplicitException:
    pass

try:
    option b
except ExplicitException:
    pass

try:
    option c
except ExplicitException:
    pass

try:
    option d
except ExplicitException:
    pass
```

### Rationale:


Used when a try clause contains too many statements.
