## R0801 (duplicate-code)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
## File #1:
x = 2
y = 3 * x
z = y + x

## File #2:
x = 2
y = 3 * x
z = y + x
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
## File #1:
x = 2
y = 3 * x
z = y + x
```

### Rationale:

Indicates that a set of similar lines has been detected among multiple files.
This usually means that the code should be refactored to avoid this
duplication.
