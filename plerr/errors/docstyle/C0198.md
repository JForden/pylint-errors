## C0198 (bad-docstring-quotes)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
def foo():
    'He exclaimed "here" and raised his hand.'
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
def foo():
    """He exclaimed "here" and raised his hand."""
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when triple quotes (either """ or ''') should be used to enclose a string that can contain both single quotes and double quotes.
