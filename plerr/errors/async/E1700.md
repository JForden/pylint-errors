## E1700 (yield-inside-async-function)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
async def foo():
    yield 42
    yield from [1, 2, 3]
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
async def foo():
    def _inner_foo():
        yield 42
        yield from [1, 2, 3]
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when an `yield` or `yield from` statement is found inside an async
function. If you are encountering this message, please contact a TA for further help.
