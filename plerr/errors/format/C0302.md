## C0302 (too-many-lines)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# module has 2000+ lines of code
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# split up and redistribute module's functions/methods to separate modules
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a module has too many lines, reducing its readability.
