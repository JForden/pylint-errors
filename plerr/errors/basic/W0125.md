## W0125 (using-constant-test)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
if CONST_VAL:
  # outcome will never change
  pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
if foo:
  # outcome will change because foo value changes
  pass
```

### Rationale:

Emitted when a conditional statement (if or ternary if) uses a constant value
for its condition test value.
