This message is raised by Python and does not belong to any PyLint checker.

Due to the open natured aspect of this error providing a specific example that would work for all cases isn't possible, however here are things to consider:
    - Are you assigning variable names correctly
    - Are you importing libraries directly
    - Are you accessing your data structures(lists,tuples,dictionaries) correctly
    - Did you create a function correctly
If you are stuck on this error, please reachout to a TA or the professor.
