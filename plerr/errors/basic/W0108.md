## W0108 (unnecessary-lambda)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
foo = lambda: min(1, 2)
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
foo = min(1, 2)
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when the lambda expression defines a function that does
nothing except take an argument and pass it on to another function.
