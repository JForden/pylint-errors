## R0123 (literal-comparison)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
value = 25
if value is 25:
    pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
value = 25
if value == 25:
    pass
```

### Rationale:

Occurs an object is being compared to a literal using `is`
instead of `==` (because `is` only checks that the left hand argument 
holds the exact same reference as the right hand argument,
which can cause an error when there are multiple instances 
of the same logical value).
