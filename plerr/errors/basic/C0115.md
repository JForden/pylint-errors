## C0115 (missing-class-docstring)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
class Foo:
    pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
class Foo:
    """A dummy docstring."""
    
    pass
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a class has no docstring - even an empty class must have a docstring.
