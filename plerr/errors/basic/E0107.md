## E0107 (nonexistent-operator)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
i = 0

while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i++
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
i = 0

while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when an attempt is made to use the C-style pre-increment or pre-decrement
operator `--` and `++`, which does not exist in Python.
