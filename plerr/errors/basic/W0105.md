## W0105 (pointless-string-statement)

### :x: Problematic code:

```console
$ cat >> system.py <<EOF
"""Module docstring."""

"system"
EOF
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```console
$ cat >> system.py <<EOF
"""Module docstring."""

value = "system"
EOF
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a string is used as a statement, which of course has no effect.
