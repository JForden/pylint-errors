## W0122 (exec-used)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
program = input('Enter code to be executed: ')
exec(program)
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
programs = {'do_something': lambda: print("Do something")}
program = input('Enter a program code to be used: ')
if programs.get(program):
    programs[program]()
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when the `exec` statement is used, to discourage its use. This does not mean
that the `exec()` function can never be used, it's simply dangerous to use it for a 
user input. If you are encountering this message, please contact a TA for further help.
