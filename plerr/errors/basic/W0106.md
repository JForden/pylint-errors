## W0106 (expression-not-assigned)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
foo = True
bar = True
foo and bar
counter=counter+1
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
foo = True
bar = True
if (foo and bar):
  counter=counter+1
```



### Rationale:

Used when an expression that is not a function call is assigned to nothing.
Probably something else was intended.
