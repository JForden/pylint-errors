## W0143 (comparison-with-callable)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
foo = True
def bar():
    pass


if foo == bar:
    pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
foo = True
def bar():
    pass


if foo == bar():
    pass
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a comparison with a function or method is made, 
which suggests that some parentheses were omitted.
