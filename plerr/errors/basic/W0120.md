## W0120 (useless-else-on-loop)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        print(i)
else:
    print('A bad value was found.')
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        print(i)
        break
else:
    print('A bad value was found.')
```

### Rationale:

Occurs because loops should only have an `else` clause if they can exit early with a `break`
statement; otherwise the statements under the `else` should be on the same scope as
the loop itself.
