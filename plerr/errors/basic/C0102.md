## C0102 (blacklisted-name)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
def bar():
    print("test")
    pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
def foo():
    print("test")
    pass
    
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when the chosen function or variable name is a key word already used in Python (to not overwrite it).
