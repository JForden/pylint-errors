## C0103 (invalid-name)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
aaa = 24
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
HOURS = 24
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when the chosen name does not conform to naming rules associated to its type
(such as constant, variable, class, etc.).

To read more about naming rules, please refer to this link:
- [StyleGuide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#type-variable-names)
