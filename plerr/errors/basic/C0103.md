## C0103 (invalid-name)


## Snake_Case    (doesn't conform to snake_case naming style):

Snake case (stylized as snake_case) refers to the style of writing in which each space is replaced by an underscore (_) character, and the first letter of each word written in lowercase.


### :x: Problematic code in a function name:

```python
def SomeFunctionName():
  print("hello world")
```
### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:
```
def some_function_name():
  print("hello world")
```
### :x: Problematic code in a variable name:

```python
SomeVariableName = 15

x=24
```
### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:
```python
some_variable_name=15

hours_in_the_day=24
```

In the example above x is changed to hours_in_the_day. non-descriptive variable names cause massive problems in large code bases and destroy code readability for anyone but the author.



## Constant Variable Names    (doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style):

Pylint is prone to labeling values as constants, even when in a programmer's eyes they are not. The reason this happens is due to how Pylint reviews the code and turns the code into an abstract data tree for evaluation. 


An example of this in practice: 

### :x: Example of Pylint saying a variable is a constant:
```python
user_play = input("Would you like to play rock, paper, scissors? y/n ")

user_win = 0 
if(user_play=="y"):
    print("Hello world")
    user_win+=1
```

In the example above, user_win would be labeled as a constant. The reason for this is, the execution of the if statement is dependent on our user_play value. In the case that the input value is "n", the if statement never runs and the value of user_win is never changed.


**What can you do?**

A simple workaround for this is to just add ```#pylint: disable=C0103``` to the line that is causing this error. If this error STILL does not go away, please contact a TA or email tabot@marquette.edu In most cases, we consider this an issue with the open-source tool Pylint and not an issue with your code(although this is subject to TA discretion). We appreciate the patience

### :heavy_check_mark: Example of Pylint saying a variable is a constant:
```python
user_play = input("Would you like to play rock, paper, scissors? y/n ")

user_win = 0 #pylint: disable=C0103
if(user_play=="y"):
    print("Hello world")
    user_win+=1
```


**NOTE: ONLY DO THIS FOR THE ERRORS THAT HAVE UPPER_CASE IN THE PYLINT WARNING STATEMENTS**

For variable names,function names,etc please use snake_case style

### Rationale:

Occurs when the chosen name does not conform to naming rules associated to its type
(such as constant, variable, class, etc.).
