## C1901 (compare-to-empty-string)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
if input() == '':
    pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
if len(input()):
    pass
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a comparison is made to an empty string constant.
It is better practice to check the length of the input using the
`len()` function instead.
