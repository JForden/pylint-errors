## W9011 (missing-return-doc)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
def foo(n):
    """An example string:

    :rtype: int
    """

    return n ** 10
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
def foo(n):
    """An example string:

    :returns: a result
    :rtype: int
    """

    return n ** 10
```

### Rationale:

Be sure to have documentation about what each method returns.
