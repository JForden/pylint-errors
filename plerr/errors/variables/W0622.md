## W0622 (redefined-builtin)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
list=["a","b","c"]
#or
str=["a","b","c"]
```

Notice in this example both lists have names that also double as function calls in Python.   

list() is a constructor that returns a list.  
str() casts an element to a string value.  

In order to avoid any confusion, change the variable names to anything that is inline with snake_case style and not already a built in function name.


### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
lista=["a","b","c"]
#or
list_of_strings=["a","b","c"]
```


### Rationale:

Used when a variable or function override a built-in.
