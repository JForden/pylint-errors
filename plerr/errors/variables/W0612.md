## W0612 (unused-variable)

### :x: Problematic code example 1:

```python
x = 1
y = None
print(x)
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code example 1:
```python
x = 1
y = None
print(x, y)
```


### :x: Problematic code example 2:

```python
for i in range(10):
  print("Hello World")
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code example 2:
```python
for _ in range(10):
  print("Hello World")
```


### :x: Problematic code example 3:
Let say you are working with a touple and you only want the first and third value as a result of the function call
```python
a, b, c = (1, 2, 3) # a = 1, b = 3
print(a, c)
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code example 2:
```python
a, _, c = (1, 2, 3) # a = 1, b = 3
print(a, c)
```


### Rationale:

Used when a variable is defined but not used.
