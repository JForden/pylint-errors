## W0612 (unused-variable)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
x = 1
y = None
print(x)
```

```python
for i in range(10):
  print("Hello World")
```

Let say you are working with a touple and you only want the first and third value as a result of the function call
```python
a, b, c = (1, 2, 3) # a = 1, b = 3
print(a, c)
```



### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
x = 1
y = None
print(x, y)
```

```python
for _ in range(10):
  print("Hello World")
```
```python
a, _, c = (1, 2, 3) # a = 1, b = 3
print(a, c)
```




### Rationale:

Used when a variable is defined but not used.
