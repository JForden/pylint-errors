## R0916 (too-many-boolean-expressions)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# Maximum number of boolean expressions in an if statement (by default max is 5)
def foo(x, y, z):
    if (x and y and z) and (x % 2 == 0 and y % 2 == 0 and z % 2 == 0):
        pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
def foo(x, y, z):
    if all([x, y, z]) and set(map(lambda n: n % 2, [x, y, z])).issubset({0}):
        pass
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when an `if` statement contains too many boolean expressions. It is best practice
to come up with an alternative block of code for the same task.
