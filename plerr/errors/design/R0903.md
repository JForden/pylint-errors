## R0903 (too-few-public-methods)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
class Foo:
    def pub1(self):
        pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
class Foo:
    def pub1(self):
        pass

    def pub2(self):
        pass
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a class has too few public methods, so be sure to verify whether it's really worth creating.
