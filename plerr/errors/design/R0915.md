## R0915 (too-many-statements)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
def foo():
    # for instance, if a fuction has too many if statements (by default, should be <= 50)
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# split up to smaller functions/methods
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a function or method has too many statements. It is best practice to split
it up into smaller functions/methods.
