## C0204 (bad-mcs-classmethod-argument)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
class Meta(type):
    @classmethod
    def foo(some):
        pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
class Meta(type):
    @classmethod
    def foo(mcs):
        pass
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a metaclass class method has a first argument named differently
than the default value `mcs`, recommended to easily differentiate them from regular
instance methods.
