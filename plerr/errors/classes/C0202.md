## C0202 (bad-classmethod-argument)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
class Foo:
    def __new__(some):
        pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
class Foo:
    def __new__(cls):
        pass
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a class method has a first argument named differently than the
default value "cls", recommended to easily differentiate it from regular instance methods.

"If the created method is an instance method then the reserved word `self` has to be used, but if the method is a class method then the keyword `cls` must be used."
