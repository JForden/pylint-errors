## C0203 (bad-mcs-method-argument)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(some):
        pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(mcs):
        pass
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a metaclass method has a first argument named differently than the
recommended `mcs` value, in order to easily differentiate them from regular instance methods.
