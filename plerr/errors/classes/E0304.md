## E0304 (invalid-length-returned)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
class Foo(object):
  def __bool__(self):
    return "example"
 
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
class Foo(object):
  def __bool__(self):
    return True
```

### Rationale:

Used when a `__bool__` method returns something which is not a bool
Occurs when a `__len__` method returns something which is a negative integer.
