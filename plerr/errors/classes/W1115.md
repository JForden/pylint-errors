## W1115 (non-str-assignment-to-dunder-name)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
print ("File1 __name__ = %s" %__name__) 
some_value=15  
  
if __name__ == some_value: 
    print ("File1 is being run directly")
else: 
    print ("File1 is being imported")
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
print ("File1 __name__ = %s" %__name__) 
  
if __name__ == "__main__": #notice how __name__ is now assigned to a string rather then an int
    print ("File1 is being run directly")
else: 
    print ("File1 is being imported")
```

### Rationale:

Non-string value assigned to `__name__` Emitted when a non-string vaue is assigned to `__name__`

Most of the programming languages use the main method or function as the starting point of execution in any program.  
But what about Python? Generally, the execution of a python program(script) starts from the very first line that is at the indentation level 0 of that program.  
However, when a python program is executed, before its execution a`__name__` variable is created.  
This variable can be used as an alternate for the main method in python.
