## W1115 (non-str-assignment-to-dunder-name)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
print ("File1 __name__ = %s" %__name__) 
some_value=15  
  
if __name__ == some_value: 
    print ("File1 is being run directly")
else: 
    print ("File1 is being imported")
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
print ("File1 __name__ = %s" %__name__) 
  
if __name__ == "__main__": #notice how __name__ is now assigned to a string rather then an int
    print ("File1 is being run directly")
else: 
    print ("File1 is being imported")
```

### Rationale:

Non-string value assigned to `__name__` Emitted when a non-string vaue is assigned to `__name__`
