## C2001 (compare-to-zero)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
if int(input()) == 0:
    pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
if bool(int(input())):
    pass
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a comparison is made to a zero constant.
It is better practice to convert the integer to a boolean value instead.
