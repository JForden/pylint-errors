## R1706 (consider-using-ternary)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
a = 10
b = 15

maximum = x > y and x or y
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
a = 10
b = 15

if x > y:
  maximum = x
else:
  maximum = y
```

### Rationale:

Used when one of the known pre-python 2.5 ternary syntax is used.
Best practice is to not use ternary syntax because it has significant drawbacks
(for example: when x is zero, the expression fails).
