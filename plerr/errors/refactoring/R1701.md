## R1701 (consider-merging-isinstance)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
if isinstance(floo, int) or isinstance(floo, float):
  print('floo is a number')
    
if isinstance(floo, int):
  if isinstance(floo, float):
    print('floo is a number')
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
if isinstance(floo, (int, float)):
  print('floo is a number')
```

### Rationale:

Used when multiple consecutive `isinstance` calls can be merged into one.
