## R1732 (no-else-continue)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
file_handle = open("some_file.txt", "r")
...
...
file_handle.close()
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
with open("some_file.txt", "r") as file_handle:
    ...
    ...
```

### Rationale:

The reason why the problematic code is incorrect is:
    You need to close that file manually after required task is done. If it's not closed, then resource (memory/buffer in this case) is wasted.

If you use "with" in the above correct example:
    there is no need to close that file. Resource de-allocation automatically happens when you use
