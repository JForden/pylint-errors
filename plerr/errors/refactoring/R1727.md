## R1727 (condition-evals-to-constant)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
A = True
B = 1
C = [1]
D = False
E = False

if A and B in C:
    D = True
else:
    E = True

print(D, E)
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
D = A and B in C
E = not D
```

### Rationale:

Emitted when a boolean condition can be simplified to a constant value.
