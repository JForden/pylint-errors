## W1116 (assert-on-string-literal)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
def avg(marks):
    assert "List is empty.",len(marks) != 0
    return sum(marks)/len(marks)

mark2 = [55,88,78,90,79]
print("Average of mark2:",avg(mark2))

mark1 = []
print("Average of mark1:",avg(mark1))
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
def avg(marks):
    assert len(marks) != 0,"List is empty." # notice how the order of the arguments to the assert statment has been flipped
    return sum(marks)/len(marks)

mark2 = [55,88,78,90,79]
print("Average of mark2:",avg(mark2))

mark1 = []
print("Average of mark1:",avg(mark1))
```

### Rationale:

Used when an assert statement has a string literal as its first argument, which will cause the assert to always pass.
