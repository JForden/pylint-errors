## W1203 (logging-fstring-interpolation)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
logger.error('oops caused by %s' % exc)
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
logger.error('oops caused by %s', exc)
```

### Rationale:

Formatting of message arguments is deferred until it cannot be avoided. However, computing the arguments passed to the logging method can also be expensive, and you may want to avoid doing it if the logger will just throw away your event.


Used when a logging statement has a call form of "logging.<logging method>(f"...")".  
Use another type of string formatting instead. You can use % formatting but leave interpolation to the logging function by passing the parameters as arguments.  
If logging-format-interpolation is disabled then you can use str.format. If logging-not-lazy is disabled then you can use % formatting as normal.
