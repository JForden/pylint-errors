## W1404 (implicit-str-concat)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
"abc" "def" == "abcdef"
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
"abc" + "def" == "abcdef" #notice how its explicit that the two strings are being combined
# or
"".join(["abc", "def"]) == "abcdef" 
```

### Rationale:

String literals are implicitly concatenated in a literal iterable definition. 

Not only is the solution cleaner then the problimatic code, it also gets rid of several issues that Python could encounter if string are not explicitly concatinnted.
