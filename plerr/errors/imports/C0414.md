## C0414 (useless-import-alias)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
from django.conf import settings as settings
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
from django.conf import settings as django_settings
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when an import alias is the same as the original package (another example: using `import numpy`
as `numpy` instead of `import numpy` as `np`).
