## E0402 (relative-beyond-top-level)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# forms.py module is not available in a current directory
from . import forms
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# forms.py available in a current directory
from . import forms
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a relative import tries to access too many levels in the current
package.
