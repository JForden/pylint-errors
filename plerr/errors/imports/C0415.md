## C0415 (import-outside-toplevel)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
def foo():
  pass

import sys
 
print('All done!')

import os
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
import os
import sys

def foo():
  pass
  
print('All done!')
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when an import statement is used anywhere other than the module
toplevel. It is best practice to move all import statements to the top of the file.
