## W0402 (deprecated-module)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
import urllib2
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
import urllib
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a module marked as deprecated (which means it may be removed from a future Python release) is attempted to be imported.
