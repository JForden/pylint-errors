## W0401 (wildcard-import)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
from flask import *
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
from flask import Flask
```

### Rationale:

This is a bad practice because it clutters namespace with unneeded modules,
packages, variables, etc. Moreover, it takes time to load them too. So best 
practice is to specify exactly what you want to import.
