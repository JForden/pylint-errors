## E0704 (misplaced-bare-raise)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
def foo(x):
    if x <= 10:
        raise
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
def foo(x):
    if x <= 10:
        raise ValueError('x should be equal or grater than 10.')
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when a bare raise is not used inside of an except clause, which generates an
error because there are no active exceptions to be re-raised.
