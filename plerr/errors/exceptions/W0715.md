## W0715 (raising-format-tuple)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
def foo():
  raise RuntimeError("Your error phrase goes here %s %s", ("a", "b"))
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
def foo():
  raise RuntimeError("Your error phrase goes here %s %s" % ("a", "b"))
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when multiple arguments are being passed to an exception constructor, 
and the first of these is a string literal containing placeholders
intended for formatting.
