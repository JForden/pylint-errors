## W0715 (raising-format-tuple)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
def foo():
  raise RuntimeError("Your error phrase goes here %s %s", ("a", "b"))
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
def foo():
  raise RuntimeError("Your error phrase goes here %s %s" % ("a", "b"))
```

### Rationale:

Used when passing multiple arguments to an exception constructor, the first
of whic is a string literal containing what appears to be placeholders intended
for formatting.
