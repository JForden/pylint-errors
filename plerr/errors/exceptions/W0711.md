## W0711 (binary-op-exception)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
try:
    1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError or ValueError:
    pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
try:
    1 / 0
except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError):
    pass
```

### Rationale:

Occurs when the exception to catch is of the form `except A or B`. If
the intention is to catch multiple exceptions, it should be rewritten
as `except (A, B)` instead.
